- Spend the night in the forest eating horse.
- Talk to a robin who turns out to be stupid and useless.
- Continue to the temple. Built into the side of a mountain.
- Slightly broken down palce. Can't see any sentries.
- We wanted Elia to soul bond with his dog so he could relay intel to us from inside. But dog Int was only 3. So we put the headband of intellect on the dog. Suddenly a genius.
