## Summary

- Parley with the Player Killers.
- "We have a middle ground person." "You have...a little brown person???"
- Suggest we all drink truth Water so we can all be frank bu Karl isn't keen.
- Karl: early versions of game were an alpha. Demon war was part of the history of the game.
- When v1.5 was released the game became easier, softer.
- Agree to a truce. They will fight with us, they will provide a sending stone.
- Boss served Bogsu a really rubbish banana daiquiri.
- Bogse eyeballs Michu throughout. Going to kill him one day.
- They bamf out of existence when we're done talking. We go up to the library.
- Looking for books on bananas. Find Baphomet.
- Yeenoghu v Baphomet was the basis of the war. Baphomet likely the instigator. Loves putting terror into people.
- Great Goddess who stepped in to end the war: Taiia.
- Taiia is the Goddess who made the world. Periods where she's awake and asleep at the same time? When she sleeps the demons fought. Asleep again now?
- Shrines to Taiia - could we visit one?
- The other three players watch the game's explainer VR video about the first demon war in sort-of-vr. Bogsū stays out reading in the library.
- In the video, they are in a labyrinth while Baphomet's Beasts attack. Elia becomes a giraffe to see over the wall.
- The Worldspire is the mountain in the centre of the continent. Much smaller in the ancient intro video!
- Find a book saying Hermes keys can be made from a combo of tiefling horn, elf heart, and human brain... This seems likely to be a veiled contract on our heads! Who knows if it's even true.
- Tsarina's house are Taiians, worshippers. Her family have been Rulers of Ym for 600 uncontested years.
- We jump out of the Starter Tower. Something is wrong though. We can see Grima but also a hell dimension racing up towards us. We try to aim towards Grima.
- Only the dog fails the save and starts falling into hell. Bogsu saves it with his glaive of returning. The dog loses a leg. The leg falls into hell.
