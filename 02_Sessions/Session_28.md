## Summary

- New +3 Glaive picked up. It is sweet.
- We are making plans to head into the Darmstadt forest to look for the maze mission.
- Ask the Zoological Society for advice on where a Howler was found.
- Giant Badger Elia digs us a hole, we make a shelter, it is rainy. Miserable night on the edge of the forest near the sea cliff.
- Elia talks to plants. They want us to enter the maze and die. Clearly Baphomet is now in charge rather than the fey.
- Leshen comes at us in the morning. In our camp. We trick it into falling in our pit.
- We kill it fairly easily and short rest. Clearly the forest wants to kill casters first.
- We journey into the maze.
- DM intervention on eating wild shaped druid: "I'm laying down the law. If someone eats an Aurochs rump steak while you're wild shaped, your character is missing an ass cheek."
- Find a ruined camp. Contains some stuff. Nothing too cool.
- We press on. Maze is clearly fucking with us.
- Then suddenly we're in a clearing at the centre. It is the Green Thingy, the pub we came to first time in the forest.
- Place is deserted but for four low level PCs. They are terrified. No sign of Leon...
- We long rest upstairs. In the morning, growling from downstairs. We descend to find a panther wolf thing.... End of ep.
