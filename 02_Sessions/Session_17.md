## Summary

- Reichhaven is our next target, back on the mainland.
- Travel back past temple.
- Ridiculously huge eagle soars overhead, doesn't come towards us.
- Find an old witch Bheurre inside a cave with a sliding entrance. Seems friendly?
- Been in game for a really long time.
- We learn from her about the five players who started the game with founders Hiki and Yukimori.
- She says she will give us five scryings if we agree to try and steal two roc eggs for her.
- Shows us Vilaine first. Place seems damaged but mostly ok. Inn we were in is in ruins. Lots of flowers laid out but not as many as there were dead players.
- We scry on Lin, Father of Bryce. We see jailer Yee interrogate him.
- We also scry on Carl. In the mayoral residence. He is sitting and writing. We manage to see his journal!
- Head out to find the roc. Attacked by kobolds on the way, make short work of them.
- We strap a bottle of the frog whisky to one and send him in. Roc eats him, turns into frog, which we catch in a jar. Grab the eggs and two feathers.
