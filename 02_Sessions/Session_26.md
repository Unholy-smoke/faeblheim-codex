## Summary

- Big fight against the slimes. One huge one. We win fairly easily. My courtesy Halberd from Boss gets melted,
- Get paid 3000 gold.
- Back into the centre of town. To the Dawn Chapel.
- Two Taian clerics giving a dead tiefling last rites. Its horns have been chopped off....
- They give me literature, a blessing, and a symbol of Taia on a wooden plaque. We thank them and leave. Kai does a lot of sniggering.
- Alayah listens in to some chat at a bar, disguised as a spider. Three adventurers in a group talking about IRL stuff, another group of assassins talking about in-world work.
- We return to Bryce's Thieves Guild apartment to sleep. Bogsu stays up to darn the symbol onto his demon armour.
- Bogsu is out early to go to the service at the Dawn Chapel. Father Obuasi Acca does the service. Nice guy. Welcomes me. Tells me he prayed for me last night - goddess Taia appeared and spoke to him about me. The most clearly he has ever seen her.
- Taia told him of three sites - shrines. One in the centre of the maze. The spine of the world. And another mysterious one.
- Back to Boss. Hard at work on weapon and dog leg. I pay for the broken halberd, and buy another outright. Back to collect things tomorrow.
