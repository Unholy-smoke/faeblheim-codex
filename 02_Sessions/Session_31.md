## Summary

- We decide to go into the cave after the dragon.
- Elia becomes a plesiosaur. "You can both ride me - I'm large."
- Bryce and Bogsū get ready to ride the druid plesiosaur into the grotty lake.
- Kai sneaks in through a tight tunnel to find the large internal cave. Drops a glowing mushroom into the water. We see it from outside, presumably so does the dragon. Dragon emerges and breath-attacks Kai who goes down fast.
- Plesiosaur plus fighters burst out of water just as the dragon goes to eat Kai.
- Bogsū pops a flying potion. We hit the dragon hard, trip attack, she falls into the pool.
- Wel follow her into the next chamber. Bryce nearly dies.
- We kill her, get loads of treasure, including two 'glitched' items - more evidence of the game breaking down. Elia tries to attune to one of them just to see...
- Adonis Blue/Dagger appears in response. Hates anything inauthentic in the game. 'Deletes' the two glitched items and gets angry when we mention anything about the outside world. He just wants to reset the game, free of players - but suggests he might be convinced if we say we are on the side of authenticity/honesty in-game. Storms off and disappear.
- We have a long chat. Bryce wants to go home to his wife but vows to help the rest of the party first. Bogsu is upset by this, says Bryce should just exit as soon as we find a Hermes key.
- In Bryce's diary, a message in response to a question he had written ('Where can I find what I seek?'. Three locations - Maze of Nightmares, Stone Giant Trial, Ceran Palace....
- We had resolved to go to the Palace next, where Bogsu may learn how the Tsarina has been receiving his regular letters of love. Also time to level up.
