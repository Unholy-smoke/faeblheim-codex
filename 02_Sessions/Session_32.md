## Summary

- After a rest we head back towards Teremin
- Mayor thanks us, place looks better already.
- Onward to Harz and to the Cinnamon Sticks.
- White skinned elf receives the briefcase. Lee-Kin Knightly. Pays us. Mysterious ice queen - surely part of the carnium.
- I pay Cronin, ex military orc. Pay him a bit to tail her, just as she walks out. Good luck orcy guy.
- Annie asks us to leave, we refuse as we've paid for our night. Tense night in our room, very quiet, but nothing happens and we leave.
- We see Cronin. He tells us he saw someone fat sneaking out out towards Teremin...
- Alayah scries on the gravedigger Johannes. Sat in a room with the mayor, and Lee-Kin...
- Briefcase is on the table. Contains deeds to every building in Teremin.
- Travel to Floros. Karl is here! We have some good chat. He is considering banning the killing of tieflings.
- Karl goes in to talk to the Tsarina. We go to some rooms to freshen up.
- Karl knocks in Bogsus door. Tsarina wants to see Alayah about the window quest.
- We have an audience with her. Goes ok. We convince her we're not baddies and a war is happening. Tell her about the prophecy. She gives her blessing to Bog taking holy orders.
- Has received his letters...but not read them yet!
- She sends envoys to Sveralt to confirm it's ruined.
- We chat with Korb and Boss. I give back the Buleit carapace armour.
- Alayah investigates the window. Adonis Blue is out there in his pocket universe. Alayah convinces him to hide himself with a glamour and the game kind of blurs out the quest for Alayah?
- Time for mass. We all attend. Kai just about manages to sit quietly.
- Bogsu says a silent prayer and feels the spirit of Taiia enter him. He is a cleric!
