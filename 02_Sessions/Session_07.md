## Summary

- Castle gardens has a Minotaur statue in the middle. Funky magic vibes from it.
- Korb is the Tsarina's master armourer making my new bulette chain shirt, additional AC. A day to make. Free!
- We use our frog poison to try to make an impression. We pretend the Tsarina is about to get frog poisoned and save her last second. We think it worked.
- Karl Gurshtiel arrived at the Palace. Big party of his flunkies. They clearly hate us.
- Castle conveniently attacked by bulezaus that night. We fucked em up. Karl Boss Michu etc not helpful.
- Convinced Tsarina we were friendly but forced to leave castle anyway, Karl's doing.
- Collected 6 glab horns to take.
- Received awesome +1 bulette armour before leaving.
