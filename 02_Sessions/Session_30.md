## Summary

- Harz tavern is called Cinnamon Sticks. In we go.
- A big clumpy noise from door across the hall. Intriguing.
- Barmaid tells us nothing about the resident. Clearly hiding something. Name is Annie. Another town, Teremin, nearby, has more trouble with the dragon.
- We buy grog and drink.
- Elia sneaks into the clumpy room as a spider to investigate. Bryce follows all sneaky. Coffin instead of a bed? That  was the clump noise.
- Along the eastern Ym coast we travel. Chilly. Towards Teremin for intel on dragon.
- Near the dragons lair, we pull out the magic boat and drift downriver towards Teremin.
- Town has a plume of black smoke rising. A pyre.
- Meet an old man. Johannes Skeinseth. Whole village decimated by poisoned water flowing from the dragon cave. Big burning pits.
- We ask him and his horse to take us up river.
- At the dragon cave are two hill giants. We sneak up and fall upon them. One goes down quick, the other flees.
- A Sahuagin maiden is sent out to talk to us. She's been ensorcelled by the dragon and isn't much use. We send her and it sounds like she gets eaten.
- We tempt the dragon to the mouth of its cave. It blasts us with poison. We chase it in.
- Do a lot of damage but it's nails. Knocks down Bogsū and Bryce, then flees into a pool that leads back into its lair. We short rest and prep to follow it in.
