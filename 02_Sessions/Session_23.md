## Summary

- Shake Czarel's hand and send him off. Good luck bud, I hope we meet again.
- Ashmogh had a Hermes Key on him.
- We use it to send Lin Larkin/Bryce's wife out of the game. Bryce has a book with him that lets him communicate with the real world. He asks it if his wife has reappeared. Seems like a yes.
- A weird guy turns up while we rest. Possibly game founder or developer? Adonis Blue, "Dagger".
- He has mad powers. Feeds us knockout booze.
- Can manipulate reality. Has a crazy magic staff. Threatens us gently and disappears.
- We journey southward towards Tsarina, and go to see Beurre the witch again. We tell her what we've learnt. She agrees to teleport us back to the Starter Tower above Grima. As soon as we arrive there with her, we are accosted by Karl and his cronies!
