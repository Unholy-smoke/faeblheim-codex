## Summary

- Tracking down the Consortium. We enter a vamp hole. Go down tunnel.
- Big fight with vamp thralls eating humans.
- Bryce's dad is in there somewhere.
- We escape by jumping on a rope ladder, swinging it back and forth. Epic trapeze act battle scene. We climb up the ladder and through the ceiling, ending up somehow in coffins that teleport us.
- Bogsu gets transported somewhere different from everyone else! Icy tundra all around. See towns in distance, all ruined by war.
