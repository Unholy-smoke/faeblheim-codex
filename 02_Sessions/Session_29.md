## Summary

- We beat the disco moose/hunter thing. It was hard as nails.
- It leaves behind half the face-mask of Baphomets general, known as Anghraboddh
- We had a long chat with L2 player character Aeschyl, who was in the tavern. Good guy. Convince him to head to Grima to try and achieve something useful.
- Find a golden dragon egg in the hearth in the Green Thingy! Cool to the touch. We take it with us.
- Back to Grima with plans to go kill the dragon (from the quest) then see the Tsarina.
- Stash the egg in Bryce's place and leave.
- Take the boat to where the green dragon is for the next quest - Harz
- Pub in town. Play cards with a fisherman. Barmaid tells us the green dragon is basically an accountant. Looks after gold but doesn't give it back?
- Lee-Kin Knightly is the quest giver.
