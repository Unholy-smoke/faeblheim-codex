## Summary

- We learn that Lin Larkin, Bryce's dad (in-game), is the head of the jeweller's guild.
- Larkin has been trading with Mrs Haingrove for blood and magic.
- I donated a pint of blood to the witch.
- Bryce gave a drop to help locate Lin.
- Visit the Glub Glub Sahuagin home. Beautiful. Uncle Serpae remembers me and we chat.
- Bogsu has learnt one word of their language: Pearl
- Glubs have a huge orange pearl they are trying to sell.
- Went to a trendy bar. Nearly drugged! Some kind of scam.
- Bogsu confesses that IRL he works for a game company that owns the 'consumer' version of Faeblheim, which isn't lethal. He is a mole in this original version of the game to learn why people want to play it (the consumer verison is far less popular).
- Qwertyuiop and Asdfghjkl - Bogsu's IRL bosses! - appear and tell us the world of Faeblheim is collapsing. Diamonds, resources, PCs all declining.
- Need to investigate.
- Demonic war that happened 3,000 years ago - in-game lore, never actually happened - is restarting somehow
- We chase off the owner of the bar who tried to rob us, and make the barmaid the new manager.
