### Overview
River town slowly poisoned by a fiscally prudent green dragon; politics sold by briefcase.

**First seen:** Session 30; **Last seen:** Session 32.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S30:** Barmaid tells us nothing about the resident. Clearly hiding something. Name is Annie. Another town, Teremin, nearby, has more trouble with the dragon.
- **S30:** Along the eastern Ym coast we travel. Chilly. Towards Teremin for intel on dragon.
- **S30:** Near the dragons lair, we pull out the magic boat and drift downriver towards Teremin.
- **S32:** After a rest we head back towards Teremin
- **S32:** We see Cronin. He tells us he saw someone fat sneaking out out towards Teremin...
- **S32:** Briefcase is on the table. Contains deeds to every building in Teremin.
