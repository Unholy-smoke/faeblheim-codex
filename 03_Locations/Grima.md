### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S01:** At front gates of city of Grima, capital of Ymlief, southern lands.
- **S01:** Town of Grima has gone stale. No new players means no new resources.
- **S01:** Head out to the distillery in Grima Darmstadt forest. Feta is the boss of the distillery. We obtain a bottle of whisky that turns people into frogs.
- **S04:** Smell coming from scribe spire in Grima. Patchouli, cumin?
- **S05:** Prepare to leave city of Grima.
- **S05:** Situated between Grima and Tsarina palace.
- **S08:** We journey by boat from Grima towards St Malia. Wrecked, washed up on an island. Pirates! We fuck them up.
- **S12:** We argue about what this means. Decide to sail back to Grima, deliver pearl message.
- **S23:** We journey southward towards Tsarina, and go to see Beurre the witch again. We tell her what we've learnt. She agrees to teleport us back to the Starter Tower above Grima. As soon as we arrive there with her, we are accosted by Karl and his cronies!
- **S24:** We jump out of the Starter Tower. Something is wrong though. We can see Grima but also a hell dimension racing up towards us. We try to aim towards Grima.
- **S29:** We had a long chat with L2 player character Aeschyl, who was in the tavern. Good guy. Convince him to head to Grima to try and achieve something useful.
- **S29:** Back to Grima with plans to go kill the dragon (from the quest) then see the Tsarina.
