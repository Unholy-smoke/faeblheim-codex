### Overview
Taiian temple in Grima; quiet miracles, measured sermons.

**First seen:** Session 26; **Last seen:** Session 26.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S26:** Back into the centre of town. To the Dawn Chapel.
- **S26:** Bogsu is out early to go to the service at the Dawn Chapel. Father Obuasi Acca does the service. Nice guy. Welcomes me. Tells me he prayed for me last night - goddess Taia appeared and spoke to him about me. The most clearly he has ever seen her.
