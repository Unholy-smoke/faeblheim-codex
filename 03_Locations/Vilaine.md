### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S13:** Try to go through a portal to Vilaine
- **S13:** Just about survived. Through to Vilaine.
- **S17:** Shows us Vilaine first. Place seems damaged but mostly ok. Inn we were in is in ruins. Lots of flowers laid out but not as many as there were dead players.
