### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S12:** Arrive at the jewellers guild. Say we're here about the sun pearl and have a message to deliver.
- **S25:** Glub glubs have taken the sun pearl. In danger of fight v players and kraken at the same time.
- **S25:** Other players run away. Kraken is L23. Sun pearl isn't sun pearl, it's a kraken egg. Just about survived. But hey we got the Squids In reward.
