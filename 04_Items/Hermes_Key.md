### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S12:** Overhear on the boat - players talking about a Hermes key tournament.
- **S23:** Ashmogh had a Hermes Key on him.
- **S24:** Find a book saying Hermes keys can be made from a combo of tiefling horn, elf heart, and human brain... This seems likely to be a veiled contract on our heads! Who knows if it's even true.
- **S25:** Now you can make a Hermes key out of tiefling horns and lungs and heart.
- **S31:** We have a long chat. Bryce wants to go home to his wife but vows to help the rest of the party first. Bogsu is upset by this, says Bryce should just exit as soon as we find a Hermes key.
