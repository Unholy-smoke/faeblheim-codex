A slow-burn extortion of Teremin via slime-poisoned economics, property deeds, and fear. Untangling the town’s finances and confronting the draconic beneficiary became a long-running arc.

**First seen:** Session 29; **Last seen:** Session 29.

### Notable beats (from notes)
- **S29:** Take the boat to where the green dragon is for the next quest - Harz
- **S29:** Pub in town. Play cards with a fisherman. Barmaid tells us the green dragon is basically an accountant. Looks after gold but doesn't give it back?
