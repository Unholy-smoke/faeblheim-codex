### Overview
A thread from Vilaine toward Reichshaven to recover Bryce’s father, complicated by Carnium interests and vampire politics.

**Aliases:** Find Lin, Lin Larkin, Rescue Lin.

**First seen:** Session 11; **Last seen:** Session 23.

### Notable beats (from notes)
- **S11:** We learn that Lin Larkin, Bryce's dad (in-game), is the head of the jeweller's guild.
- **S20:** Bogsu not present - party reunite and fight their way to safety along with Lin Larkin, who is traumatised and has lost an arm.
- **S23:** We use it to send Lin Larkin/Bryce's wife out of the game. Bryce has a book with him that lets him communicate with the real world. He asks it if his wife has reappeared. Seems like a yes.
