### Notable beats (from notes)
- **S23:** A weird guy turns up while we rest. Possibly game founder or developer? Adonis Blue, "Dagger".
- **S31:** Adonis Blue/Dagger appears in response. Hates anything inauthentic in the game. 'Deletes' the two glitched items and gets angry when we mention anything about the outside world. He just wants to reset the game, free of players - but suggests he might be convinced if we say we are on the side of authenticity/honesty in-game. Storms off and disappear.
- **S32:** Karl knocks in Bogsus door. Tsarina wants to see Alayah about the window quest.
- **S32:** Alayah investigates the window. Adonis Blue is out there in his pocket universe. Alayah convinces him to hide himself with a glamour and the game kind of blurs out the quest for Alayah?
