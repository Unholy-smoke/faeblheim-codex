### Notable mentions (from notes)
- **S04:** Are the founders behind Baphomet???
- **S24:** Looking for books on bananas. Find Baphomet.
- **S24:** Yeenoghu v Baphomet was the basis of the war. Baphomet likely the instigator. Loves putting terror into people.
- **S24:** In the video, they are in a labyrinth while Baphomet's Beasts attack. Elia becomes a giraffe to see over the wall.
- **S28:** Elia talks to plants. They want us to enter the maze and die. Clearly Baphomet is now in charge rather than the fey.
- **S29:** It leaves behind half the face-mask of Baphomets general, known as Anghraboddh
