### Overview
I have this diary because [[Dikny]] insists I try Daily Pages, from a book she read back in the Old World. I think she used to be a playwright. No wonder she’s here.

### From Codex 1.0
- I have this diary because [[Dikny]] insists I try Daily Pages, from a book she read back in the Old World. I think she used to be a playwright. No wonder she’s here.
- I honestly hate the thought of writing this shit down, but with everything that’s happening, she says it’ll help me decompress, and sort of my thoughts out. Let’s see. I guess I’m already starting. Ugh, Christ I hate this meta writing shit.
- First thing’s first. My city is falling apart. Ever since those guys slipped through my filter, everything’s gone wrong. My home, once so comfortable and safe, is a terror town filled with people who don’t want to do anything for fear that they’ll upset someone else and get stabbed for it. Why did they tell everyone about pvp? What are they up to?
- [[Boss]] suggests they were sent in by [[Hiki]] or [[Kimori]]] – maybe even [[The_Monarchs]]? – to clear out the game. Remove the PVP block, then they come in and summon demons all over the place, all to kill as many people as possible so they can close it down without actively doing the killing themselves. But then why would Hiki or Kimori or anyone want to do that?
- The alternative is they’re malicious people – or worse, fucking imbeciles - who stumbled into the key for demon summoning and are just doing whatever they want everywhere they go. Why? What joy is it bringing them to ruin other people’s bliss, and happiness?
- Who do they think they are to police the fun other people are having? I don’t go to the community children’s paddling pool and knock their dicks outta their hands so why can’t they leave me the fuck alone in my game? It doesn’t matter what the queen does, exiling them, they’ll just raise hell wherever the fuck they are. Soon it’ll reach [[Grima]].
- Hell, it already is. Now I got people being recruited into the fucking army. Where is my city going? People killing each other, people being drafted. I got nothing left.
- And they’ll have to pay.
