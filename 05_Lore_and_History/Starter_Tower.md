### Overview
Starter Tower: lore entry consolidated from session notes and earlier codex references.

**First seen:** Session 23; **Last seen:** Session 24.

### Notable mentions (from notes)
- **S23:** We journey southward towards Tsarina, and go to see Beurre the witch again. We tell her what we've learnt. She agrees to teleport us back to the Starter Tower above Grima. As soon as we arrive there with her, we are accosted by Karl and his cronies!
- **S24:** We jump out of the Starter Tower. Something is wrong though. We can see Grima but also a hell dimension racing up towards us. We try to aim towards Grima.
