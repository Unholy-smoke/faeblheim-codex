### Overview
Ruler of Ymleif; cautious but pragmatic monarch who granted audiences about looming war and tolerated uncomfortable truths.

**Aliases:** Queen Usdoxia, Tsarina, Usdoxia.

**First seen:** Session 01; **Last seen:** Session 32.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S01:** Tsarina is apparently considering drafting people into army. War is coming. With whom?
- **S05:** Situated between Grima and Tsarina palace.
- **S06:** Audience with Tsarina. Dorphin is Duke of the Southeast.  Clearly misleading Tsarina.
- **S07:** Korb is the Tsarina's master armourer making my new bulette chain shirt, additional AC. A day to make. Free!
- **S07:** We use our frog poison to try to make an impression. We pretend the Tsarina is about to get frog poisoned and save her last second. We think it worked.
- **S07:** Convinced Tsarina we were friendly but forced to leave castle anyway, Karl's doing.
- **S18:** Scry on Tsarina. She doesn't seem to be doing much in her palace.
- **S23:** We journey southward towards Tsarina, and go to see Beurre the witch again. We tell her what we've learnt. She agrees to teleport us back to the Starter Tower above Grima. As soon as we arrive there with her, we are accosted by Karl and his cronies!
- **S24:** Tsarina's house are Taiians, worshippers. Her family have been Rulers of Ym for 600 uncontested years.
- **S29:** Back to Grima with plans to go kill the dragon (from the quest) then see the Tsarina.
