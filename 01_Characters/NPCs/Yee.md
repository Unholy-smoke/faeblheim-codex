### Overview
Jailer connected to the Carnium’s disappearances; keeper of keys and silences.

**First seen:** Session 17; **Last seen:** Session 24.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S17:** We scry on Lin, Father of Bryce. We see jailer Yee interrogate him.
- **S21:** We need to kill Ashmogh. He is the leader of the gnolls and is doing a ritual to summon demon god Yeenoghu. This is the demon war happening again.
- **S21:** Killing Ashmogh would end the ritual to summon Yeenoghu
- **S24:** Yeenoghu v Baphomet was the basis of the war. Baphomet likely the instigator. Loves putting terror into people.
