### Overview
Ex‑military orc in Harz; paid to tail Lee‑Kin from Cinnamon Sticks toward Teremin.

**First seen:** Session 32; **Last seen:** Session 32.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S32:** I pay Cronin, ex military orc. Pay him a bit to tail her, just as she walks out. Good luck orcy guy.
- **S32:** We see Cronin. He tells us he saw someone fat sneaking out out towards Teremin...
