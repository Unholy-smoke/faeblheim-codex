### Overview
Gnoll warlord mid‑ritual to call Yeenoghu; history interrupted.

**First seen:** Session 21; **Last seen:** Session 23.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S21:** We need to kill Ashmogh. He is the leader of the gnolls and is doing a ritual to summon demon god Yeenoghu. This is the demon war happening again.
- **S21:** Ashmogh is in Me-Na. Czarel tells us Ashmogh will fight fair if we challenge him one on one.
- **S21:** Killing Ashmogh would end the ritual to summon Yeenoghu
- **S22:** Faced Ashmogh. Enormous battle where Bogsu challenges him, they fight one on one for a while, then the players jump in. Lots of gnolls die.
- **S22:** Bogsu obtained Ashmogh's demon armour and chain of returning.
- **S23:** Ashmogh had a Hermes Key on him.
