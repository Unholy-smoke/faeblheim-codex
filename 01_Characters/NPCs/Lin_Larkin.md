### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S01:** Confronted by a group calling themselves Player Killers, but survived.
- **S04:** We dance and play violin to distract from Bryce breaking into pimporium.
- **S04:** Killed a spectator in the sewers, was controlling rats
- **S11:** We learn that Lin Larkin, Bryce's dad (in-game), is the head of the jeweller's guild.
- **S11:** Bryce gave a drop to help locate Lin.
- **S11:** Qwertyuiop and Asdfghjkl - Bogsu's IRL bosses! - appear and tell us the world of Faeblheim is collapsing. Diamonds, resources, PCs all declining.
- **S17:** We scry on Lin, Father of Bryce. We see jailer Yee interrogate him.
- **S19:** We escape by jumping on a rope ladder, swinging it back and forth. Epic trapeze act battle scene. We climb up the ladder and through the ceiling, ending up somehow in coffins that teleport us.
- **S20:** Bogsu not present - party reunite and fight their way to safety along with Lin Larkin, who is traumatised and has lost an arm.
- **S21:** Killing Ashmogh would end the ritual to summon Yeenoghu
- **S23:** We use it to send Lin Larkin/Bryce's wife out of the game. Bryce has a book with him that lets him communicate with the real world. He asks it if his wife has reappeared. Seems like a yes.
