### Overview
Harz barmaid at Cinnamon Sticks; polite until paid to be otherwise.

**First seen:** Session 30; **Last seen:** Session 32.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S30:** Barmaid tells us nothing about the resident. Clearly hiding something. Name is Annie. Another town, Teremin, nearby, has more trouble with the dragon.
- **S32:** Annie asks us to leave, we refuse as we've paid for our night. Tense night in our room, very quiet, but nothing happens and we leave.
