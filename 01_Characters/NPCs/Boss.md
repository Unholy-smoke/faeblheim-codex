### Overview
Master smith and artificer operating in Grima; turns monster parts into wearable poetry and has little patience for nonsense.

**First seen:** Session 01; **Last seen:** Session 32.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S01:** Mayor is apparently Player Killer boss!
- **S01:** Head out to the distillery in Grima Darmstadt forest. Feta is the boss of the distillery. We obtain a bottle of whisky that turns people into frogs.
- **S05:** Deekney, Michu, Boss are Mayor Carl's three mates. Deekney is his wife. Assume they are all players.
- **S07:** Castle conveniently attacked by bulezaus that night. We fucked em up. Karl Boss Michu etc not helpful.
- **S11:** Qwertyuiop and Asdfghjkl - Bogsu's IRL bosses! - appear and tell us the world of Faeblheim is collapsing. Diamonds, resources, PCs all declining.
- **S24:** Boss served Bogsu a really rubbish banana daiquiri.
- **S25:** We leave Boss' forge. He is working on my glaive and a robot leg for the dog.
- **S26:** Big fight against the slimes. One huge one. We win fairly easily. My courtesy Halberd from Boss gets melted,
- **S26:** Back to Boss. Hard at work on weapon and dog leg. I pay for the broken halberd, and buy another outright. Back to collect things tomorrow.
- **S32:** We chat with Korb and Boss. I give back the Buleit carapace armour.
