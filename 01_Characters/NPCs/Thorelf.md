### Overview
Human fighter; late add to the roster; high risk, low chill.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S05:** Meet Thorelf the human fighter. Player, just arrived, possible psycho? Strange that he is the only other new player who wasn't killed on arrival recently.
- **S18:** Scry on psycho guy Thorelf. He is a psycho.
