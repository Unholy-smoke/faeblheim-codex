### Overview
Storm‑minded power broker of Habis; the weather takes notes from him.

**First seen:** Session 08; **Last seen:** Session 09.

### Notable moments (from notes)
- **S08:** Habis is the town on a island. Tenris is the island leader baddie who we need to track down.
- **S09:** Tenris is the island leader. Mage. But apparently not on the island?
