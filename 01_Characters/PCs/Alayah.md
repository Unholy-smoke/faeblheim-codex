### Overview
Alayah—spelled variously as Alaya, Eliah, Alaiya, or whatever Common decides today—is a druid who treats mysteries like ecosystems: map the predators, nurture the prey, and introduce a controlled burn where appropriate. They are patient with forests, impatient with tyrants, and uncommonly persuasive with eldritch entities that live behind suspicious windows. Ask five officials to write their name and you’ll get six answers; Alayah seems content to let reality argue with itself while they get on with the work.

### Background & Drive
Some druids wander until the world feels familiar. Alayah wandered until it felt **strange enough**. They collect patterns the way others collect trinkets: tides in politics, migration of rumours, and the way grief flows downhill through a city. The natural world taught them responsibility without supervision; the unnatural world taught them the joy of saying “no” to people who expected “yes.” Their compass swings toward places where power has pooled too long—rotting wells that need opening, greedy roots that need pruning. Not crusading, exactly. Gardening, but for societies—and with more bears.

### Track Record (So Far)
They spoke with sahuagin like neighbours over a fence and helped turn a kraken‑egg “pearl” crisis into an understanding rather than a shipwreck. They traced poison through a town to the ledger behind it, helping to unwind a green dragon’s slow‑motion asset strip. They haggled with a witch whose house has a sliding door and a sliding morality, and somehow left with future favours and intact eyebrows. At the palace, Alayah peered through a certain window into a pocket‑reality, met Adonis Blue, and convinced him to paint a glamour over himself and **stay quiet** while the party moved the board. When the rest of us needed eyes in unseen rooms, Alayah scried, listened, and returned with maps the brave could actually use.

### Signature Abilities
- **Wild Shape, Wise Shape:** They turn into the right creature at the right time—scout, shield, or stampede—never spectacle for spectacle’s sake.
- **Control & Care:** Entangles fights until they behave; heals people until they remember they’re brave. Also excellent at reminding allies to drink water.
- **Investigative Rituals:** If there’s a thread, Alayah will find it, label it, and hand it to you with tea. If there isn’t, they’ll spin one from spider silk and stubbornness.
- **Diplomacy with Teeth:** A calm voice that implies the forest is listening—and the forest is on their side.

### Quirks & Relationships
They keep notes pressed with leaves, study city maps like river deltas, and consider hospitality a defensive spell. They trust Bogsū’s centre of gravity, treat Bryce’s charm like a renewable resource, and cheer Kai’s fireworks even when the drapes are flammable. Witches respect them. Bureaucrats worry about them. Both are correct. Also: if you spell their name “Elia,” they will answer; if you spell it “Alaiah,” they will also answer; if you insist there’s a single correct spelling, they will smile the way trees smile at axes that forget to check their edge.

### Where They Shine
When the obvious road has a toll you shouldn’t pay, Alayah finds the path that touches moss and avoids traps. They are the party’s conscience and its caution, yes—but also its audacity: the person who will knock on the universe and ask it to keep the noise down while we work. Offer them an impossible problem and they will compost it into three manageable ones, then invite you to plant something better in the space left over. The name on the wanted poster may vary; the results are remarkably consistent.
