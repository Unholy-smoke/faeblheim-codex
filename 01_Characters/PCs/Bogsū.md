### Overview
Bogsū started life as the party’s resident slab of resolve—an honest fighter with a glaive, a prayer he hadn’t quite learned yet, and a talent for getting in the way of danger so his friends didn’t have to. Somewhere between bulette-chopping, windmill-de-slime-ing, and a few too many near misses, Taiia noticed. Now he’s both hammer **and** hymn: a battlemaster who picked up a holy calling without putting the glaive down.

### Background & Drive
Raised on simple promises—stand your post, mean what you say, pay what you owe—Bogsū has always worn loyalty like armour. He’s the one who squares up to the awkward conversation, hands the trophy back to its rightful owner, and then quietly pays for the repairs. The Tsarina’s blessing to take holy orders didn’t change him; it clarified him. Bogsū isn’t angling for sainthood. He’s angling to make sure his people see the sunrise.

### Track Record (So Far)
He has negotiated with sahuagin without losing fingers, helped unpoison a town that a fiscally responsible dragon was slowly asset-stripping, handed in monster parts without demanding a parade, and stood tall while court politics tried to make everyone shorter. When Alayah talked a reality-tuning founder into keeping a low profile, Bogsū made sure there **was** a profile to hide behind. At mass he knelt, listened, and—miracle of miracles—rose a cleric, the warmth of Taiia settling into the cracks left by battle.

### Signature Abilities
- **Battlemaster’s Toolkit:** Feints, ripostes, and the kind of controlled aggression that turns a crowded melee into a tidy queue.
- **New Light:** Fresh clerical magic—mending flesh, warding friends, and brandishing radiant answers to very rude questions.
- **Anchor Instincts:** If the rest of the party is a kite in a storm, Bogsū is the stone that kindly refuses to fly.
- **Decent Humaning:** People tell him the truth because he keeps giving it back to them, unvarnished and usable.

### Quirks & Relationships
He side-eyes Michu on principle, respects Karl more than he admits, and collects improbable friends the way smithies collect burn marks. The Nameless Inn keeps his favourite chair ready; Korb keeps his measurements on file; Leon keeps a friendly eye on the glaive’s edge. Bogsū does not boast. He does, however, allow facts to be observed aloud in his vicinity.

### Where He Shines
Put him between civilians and a problem and you’ll see why gods court mortals. Bogsū shines when a path must be held, a promise must be kept, or a creature needs to realise—politely but firmly—that it has come to the wrong neighbourhood. Faith didn’t tame him; it taught his strength a direction. Now the party has something rare: a wall that can sing.
