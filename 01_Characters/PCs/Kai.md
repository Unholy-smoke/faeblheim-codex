### Overview
Kai is a tiefling sorcerer with wild magic like weather: mostly sunny, occasionally dramatic, and once in a while the kind of lightning strike that gives a city a new statue. They do not so much solve problems as **rearrange** them until a solution falls out. The results are frequently beautiful and always memorable.

### Background & Drive
Raised on a diet of sideways looks and sideways plans, Kai learned early that doing things the normal way meant doing them someone else’s way. Magic offered an alternative—one that was loud, colourful, and unreasonably effective. They’re not chasing power so much as **freedom**: room to be themselves, and to make sure other people get the same chance no matter what their horns, histories, or hometowns look like.

### Track Record (So Far)
Kai has assisted in diplomacy by being interesting enough that everyone briefly forgets war; survived negotiations with sahuagin by turning the vibe from “sharks” to “sparkles”; and nearly behaved for the entire duration of a formal mass (a miracle, by all accounts). They’ve helped stall a dragon’s slow-burn crime, misdirected assassins with charm and smoke, and carried messages the universe didn’t want delivered—then delivered them anyway.

### Signature Abilities
- **Wild Magic Surges:** Chaos with training wheels. Kai rides the wave and somehow lands on the right square.
- **Arcane Versatility:** Illusion here, force there, a dash of teleport when the door is doing its best impression of a wall.
- **Performance Under Fire:** If attention is a battlefield, Kai is artillery—dazzle, distract, and then the quiet knife arrives.
- **Empathic Edge:** Finds the person in the monster and the joke in the tragedy, and uses both responsibly…ish.

### Quirks & Relationships
They fidget through sermons, collect compliments the way others collect coins, and name their tricks like pets. Kai adores Bryce’s panache, borrows Alayah’s patience (with interest), and treats Bogsū like a mobile safe zone. They flirt with danger and sometimes with bartenders. Results vary; stories don’t.

### Where They Shine
Give Kai a stalemate and they’ll manufacture a new set of rules. Need to exit a room that insists on being a room? Kai will convince it to be a hallway. They are the party’s spark plug and its pressure valve, and when the day needs colour, they bring a whole paintbox.
