### Overview
Bryce Larkin is the swashbuckler who read the fine print and decided to write some new clauses. He wears trouble like a well-cut coat and has never met a window he didn’t consider a door. If the party needs a smile at court, a blade in a stairwell, or a getaway planned three scenes in advance, Bryce is already there—probably with a quip, definitely with a plan.

### Background & Drive
Born into the kind of family where “jeweller” means half guild, half spy-ring, Bryce grew up learning the value of a flawless cut—be it gem, reputation, or timing. Family obligations tug like tide: the search for answers around his father Lin’s captivity, the complicated debts that come with guild politics, and the quiet promise he keeps to those who didn’t make it out. Under the panache is a stubborn line: no one gets to tell the story of his people without him in the room.

### Track Record (So Far)
Bryce danced through sahuagin negotiations without getting damp, helped unpick the puzzle of a town sold out from under itself, and smiled pleasantly while very dangerous nobles measured his neck for metaphorical collars. He followed a trail of whispers from Vilaine toward Reichshaven, threaded through Yee’s keys and the Carnium’s silences, and found momentum instead of despair. When the party steals a book, Bryce makes sure the **consequences** are what they planned to steal all along.

### Signature Abilities
- **Blade & Footwork:** Rapier precision, alleyway athleticism, and a nose for the one square no one is watching.
- **Social Acrobatics:** Reads rooms like ledgers. Can launder a rumour in three questions or fewer.
- **Exit Strategy:** If it has hinges, stairs, or gravity, Bryce will convert it into a strategy. Occasionally a hobby.
- **Shiny Things Sense:** Not greed—**curation**. The world puts secrets in boxes; Bryce insists on better boxes.

### Quirks & Relationships
He is allergic to sloppy lies and enthusiastic incompetence. He keeps a professional fondness for thieves who have standards, a wary courtesy for monarchs who remember names, and a growing gratitude for a dragon bartender who doesn’t ask questions he wouldn’t answer himself. He teases Bogsū like a brother, trusts Alayah’s instincts like a compass, and delights in Kai’s fireworks even when they go off during the sermon.

### Where He Shines
Drop Bryce into moving politics and he swims. Give him a narrow ledge, and he dances. He’s the party’s vector: the line from “we heard a rumour” to “we own the room,” all without losing the hat. The mission might be messy, but the ending? Bryce edits it until it sings.
